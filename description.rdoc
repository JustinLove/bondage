== DESCRIPTION:

class Binding stinks, module Bondage stinks less.  Bondage provides hashes of local, global, instance, etc. variables, and provides the Enumerable interface for locals directly.  It also provides [] syntax to get/set binding variables directly.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Note that hashes provided by locals & co are plain old hashes (writing to them won't affect the binding) with references to the real data (modifying the values themselves will be reflected in the binding.)
* Warning: Uses eval internally, so don't use it with untrusted data.  An attempt is made to sanitize identifier names.  However, if your implementation doesn't support ObjectSpace, the second argument to []= is still evaled directly.
